<h2>Contests-Engine</h2>
<p>
  This URL provides access to the public API of the <i>Contests-Engine</i>, a tournament management back-end system that handles contests, participants, draws, matches and the like for almost any contest (football championships, tennis trophies, billard tournaments and so on).
</p>
<p>
  The goal of the <i>Contests-Engine</i> is to let developers of tournament management front-ends (websites, mobile apps, desktop apps, ...) concentrate on the presentation layer of their systems, e.g.
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fast and simple data entry forms</li>
    <li>Easy definition of a draw by dragging around participants on the empty tableau</li>
    <li>Elegant renderings of large groups- or knock-out-tableaus with scrolling and zooming</li>
  </ul>
  and so on. The <i>Contest-Engine</i> in the background then handles tasks as
  <ul>
    <li>Store, update and retrieve all data of the contests</li>
    <li>Randomly fill an incomplete draw or create an entire draw with due regard to special rules like seed lists</li>
    <li>Create the matches for each round according to the type of the contest (round robin, groups, elimination or double-elimination game, ...) </li>
    <li>Keep everything actualized whenever a new result is received, e.g. propagate the winner of a elimination game to the next round or group winners to the final group or elimination round</li>
    <li>Distribute points for wins, losses and eventually ties, calculate rankings</li>
  </ul>
</p>
