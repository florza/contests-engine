<h2>iTurnier-Backend</h2>
<p>
  This URL provides access to the backend of the iTurnier II application.
</p>
<p>
  With the exception of this single page, it does not directly serve any web pages, but is accessed from frontend applications (other web pages or apps) over an API, with REST services to:
  <ul>
    <li>create a contest and participants</li>
    <li>create a draw</li>
    <li>create the contest tableau with all the matches</li>
    <li>edit match results and update the tableau</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  The application is still under development. For details, send a mail to <a href="mailto:rolf.zanga@icloud.com">rolf.zanga@icloud.com</a>.
