<h2>iTurnier-Backend</h2>
<p>
  This URL provides access to the backend of the iTurnier II application.
</p>
<p>
  It does not provide its own web pages and descriptions, but is accessed from frontend applications over an API, with REST services to:
  <ul>
    <li>create a contest and participants</li>
    <li>create a draw</li>
    <li>create the contest tableau with all the matches</li>
    <li>edit match results and update the tableau</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  The application is still under development. For details, send a mail to <a href="mailto:rolf.zanga@icloud.com">rolf.zanga@icloud.com</a>.
